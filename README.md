This repository serves as my practice ground for honing my skills in JavaScript, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data structures in JavaScript. Through a series of mini projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and strengthen my proficiency in these areas. The projects included here are designed to provide hands-on experience and practical insights into JavaScript programming, OOP principles, and various data structures. By actively engaging with these exercises, I aspire to build a solid foundation in programming and enhance my problem-solving abilities.
