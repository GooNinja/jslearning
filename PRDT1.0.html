        A variable that has not been assigned a value
        // means that data type is not defined
        //null
       // null represents an intentional absence of a value. It's usually set on purpose to indicate that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned any value. null is different from the similar primitive value undefined , which is an unintentional absence of any object value.
      <p>undefined is a primitive value that represents the absence of any value, while null is another primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any value.</p>
